# Welcome to REST 2.0!  
## Why we're switching it up again.  
The original version of REST was made to sync up to our Google Sheets data.
While that was nice, we decided to make the data internal instead from now on.
This is so we can make this tool easier to use and it gives us more control
over what we do with the information stored in it.  

This new version also allows for more conventional methods of writing forms
for use in the application using Markdown syntax (a fancy word for letting
us use links and format the data in-line). This makes the tool more accessible
for anybody involved in creating forms for REST 2.0.  
This allows for anybody using the tool to make forms that look like this:
